# scripts
A collection of all the small scripts I've made that don't fully deserve their own repository but why not throw them up.

### gravity.py:
- 3D n-body simulation (visualized in 3-d but would theoretically scale to any dimension with vector calculations)

### dnd
- Voice recognition application designed to listen during Dungeons & Dragons and change Philips light colours to match the current setting

### Champion.py:
- Apex Legend video game screen capture program with image processing/OCR to change Philips Hue lights green upon victory

### rainbow.py 
- Philips Hue light controller, slowly cycling all lights at equally spaced colours (on an HSV spectrum)

### blackjack.ipynb
- Notebook setup to simulate a game of blackjack with proper inheritance and easy scalability
