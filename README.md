# scripts
A collection of all the small scripts I've made that don't fully deserve their own repository but why not throw them up.

### millikan
- Archaic computer vision script used as a proof of concept for oil drop tracking during the Millikan Oil Drop experiment

### gravity.py:
- 3D n-body simulation (visualized in 3-d but would theoretically scale to any dimension with vector calculations)

### dnd
- Voice recognition application designed to listen during Dungeons & Dragons and change Philips light colours to match the current setting
- Additional scripts for attack roll simulations (separate from the voice application, just for optimizing game strategy)

### phys411
- Old class assignment, used as a pre-test to see how well I'd fare before registering

### Champion.py:
- Apex Legend video game screen capture program with image processing/OCR to change Philips Hue lights green upon victory

### rainbow.py 
- Philips Hue light controller, slowly cycling all lights at equally spaced colours (on an HSV spectrum)

### blackjack.ipynb
- Notebook setup to simulate a game of blackjack with proper inheritance and easy scalability 

### poker.ipynn
- Notebook for playing a game of poker. Primitive, have yet to rank hands and decide a winner
